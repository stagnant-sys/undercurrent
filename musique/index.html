        Stratovarius - Fourth Dimension
    </div>
    <div class="content-card__subtitle">
        A new forray into power metal
    </div>
    <div class="content-card__text">
        <p>Early Stratovarius has a tendency to surprise. The band kept changing at a pretty rapid pace during their first albums and they had their very proggy, experimental moments here and there. But hey, to me that's a good thing. Better listen to music that's trying to find its way than music that is stuck in a rut.</p>
        <button class="more-text__button">Read more...</button>
        <div class="more-text">
        <p>On Fourth Dimension the band has clearly taken a step closer to their eventual destination - pointlessly cheery, wank-happy neoclassical euro-power metal. The melodies are now quite anthemic and you usually get a pretty good feeling listening to this album thanks to the energy and talented playing. Timo Kotipelto, the new singer, also has a clear tone of voice, well-suited for power metal, and he was a great pick for this band.</p>
        <p>But then... as surely as a Bond villain trap slowly lowers James Bond into a shark pit, the unwitting listener is subjected to more and more bumpy experimentation as the album progresses. You could say Fourth Dimension starts out as a fun, well-meaning power metal album but eventually takes you through outer space and into other dimensions, and you're lucky if you survive intact from the trip.</p>
        <p>First slightly out-of-place song is the very 80's sounding but mostly harmless "Galaxies". Then we get to "Winter" which is the one of the slowest Stratovarius songs in existence, almost like some sort of symphonic doom metal - quite uncharacteristic of the band. We reach the apex of messy experimenting on "030366", some type of industrial-laced oddity that the band itself probably wants to forget exists. After that, "Nightfall" too plods along at a slow pace and focuses on creating an interesting ambience through various effects instead of being balls-to-the-wall catchy. Gotta appreciate the imaginative approach... On the same note, while there are a few slower songs, there isn't a real power ballad on Fourth Dimension, which is pretty neat. More power metal albums should do this.</p>
        <p>As expected of neoclassically influenced metal, these songs have an elegant air to them and Tolkki's shredding is highly impressive to experience. It's just a shame that while the band's talent is world-class, Tolkki's lyrics skills are still at a kindergarten-level and there are plenty of truly cringe-worthy moments throughout the album. Cheapens the sense of adventure somewhat. Still, this is the first uplifting and genuinely "power metal" Stratovarius album. It's not as straightforward and fully realized as their later albums but it makes up for it in chaotic creativity.</p>

        Spock's Beard - Feel Euphoria
    </div>
    <div class="content-card__subtitle">
        The Spock's feeling young
    </div>
    <div class="content-card__text">
        <p> If you're comparing Spock's Beard to Genesis, then Feel Euphoria is to A Trick of the Tail as Snow is to The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. In both cases, you have a situation where the charismatic frontman of the group has left after the band has just completed an ambitious double album, and the drummer (in this case Nick D'Virgilio) has stepped into the gap.</p>
        <button class="more-text__button">Read more...</button>
        <div class="more-text">
            <p>Actually, in some ways Spock's Beard had it harder than Genesis. Sure, Peter Gabriel was important to Genesis - but he didn't exert such a heavy influence on the songwriting process as Neal Morse did in Spock's Beard before his departure. Genesis were fairly collaborative about how they did songwriting, whereas a large majority of Spock's Beard's material from The Light to Snow has Neal as the sole credited songwriter.</p>
            <p>This means that for Feel Euphoria Spock's Beard had not one challenge but two: not only did they have to bed in a new vocalist, but they also had to adapt to a new songwriting and recording process - without Neal's steady hand at the tiller, but also with the new creative opportunities which naturally arise in such a situation.</p>                
            <p>The end result doesn't entirely sound like the earlier Beard, but it's not so far away either. The mixture of modern rock and classic prog influences is still there, but the proportions are subtly different, as are the selections of what exactly the band take from each of those worlds. Some of the more left-field influences - like musicals, gospel, and Latin music - that Neal would toss in from time to time are dialled back; other sounds which haven't been a major part of the Beard's fabric start to creep in. (There's an electronic edge to the opening sections of the starting track which feels particularly fresh to Spock's Beard.)</p>                
            <p>Is it a masterwork on the level of, say, V? No. But under the circumstances, I don't think you could reasonably expect Spock's Beard to produce one - the odds were always in favour of this being a transitional album which was hampered by the adjustment they needed to make.</p>                
            <p>At the same time, it's significantly better than I expected. I don't envy the Beard the position they were in, and I'm sure they must have had a long think about whether it would be better to take their time about putting out a followup in order to give themselves time to adjust to the shift in band chemistry and really work on honing some new material, or work quickly in order to maintain their momentum and send the message that they were here to stay. In the end, they had the confidence to take the latter approach, and Feel Euphoria is good enough that I think that gamble paid off.</p>

        My Dying Bride - Like Gods of the Sun
    </div>
    <div class="content-card__subtitle">
        A new direction
    </div>
    <div class="content-card__text">
        <p>"Like Gods of the Sun" is the 4th full-length studio album by UK doom/death metal act My Dying Bride. The album was released through Peaceville Records in October 1996. It´s the successor to "The Angel and the Dark River" from 1995 and features the same sextet lineup who recorded the predecessor. It would however be the last album to feauture drummer Rick Miah and keyboard player/violinist Martin Powell.</p>
        <button class="more-text__button">Read more...</button>
        <div class="more-text">
            <p>The material on "Like Gods of the Sun" continue the dark and gothic tinged doom metal sound of "The Angel and the Dark River (1995)", and as the case also was on the predecessor "Like Gods of the Sun" solely features clean vocals. At this point it seemed the growling vocals had been completely abandoned and a choice had been made to continue only singing clean vocals (in retrospect we now know that would change later in their career, but back then this was the reality). "Like Gods of the Sun" feels like the natural successor to "The Angel and the Dark River (1995)" and the two albums share an overall similar sound. Dark, gothic, and heavy doom metal with clean vocals, melancholic violin themes and atmosphere enchancing keyboards/piano.</p>
            <p>While "The Angel and the Dark River (1995)" and "Like Gods of the Sun" share a similar sound, there are also great differences between the two. The former is often quite an adventurous album with experimental ideas and unconventional song structures, while the latter is in many ways a much more formulaic and predictable release. "Like Gods of the Sun" features well defined vers/chorus structures and it´s the time in My Dying Bride´s career they came closest to sounding mainstream. Mainstream in this context should of course be understood as underground mainstream, as it´s doubtful you´ll ever hear My Dying Bride on the radio.</p>
            <p>My Dying Bride still incorporate sections and ideas you wouldn´t hear on a normal 3 minutes long vers/chorus structured track, so in that respect "Like Gods of the Sun" isn´t easy listening material. The tracks are relatively catchy upon initial listen, although it´s not an album featuring many standout tracks. The two tracks bookending the album (the title track and "For My Fallen Angel") stand out the most. The title track because it´s the most memorable and most well composed track on the album (an album where many tracks feature rather awkward abrupt changes between sections), and "For My Fallen Angel" because it´s a track featuring only keyboards/synths, violin, and a spoken word passage by lead vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe. Stainthorpe continues his dramatic almost crying gothic tinged clean vocal style of the predecessor, but he takes it even further on this album.</p>
            <p>"Like Gods of the Sun" features a dark and heavy sounding production, which is professional and well sounding, but actually doesn´t suit My Dying Bride´s music that well. It´s too massive and details are lost, and don´t get me started on the clicky drum sound...</p>
            <p>...so upon conclusion "Like Gods of the Sun" is an album with both good qualities and some that aren´t that great, and to my ears it´s probably the least interesting album in the band´s discography. They sound too comfortable and not willing to experiment and push boundaries like they did on all three preceding releases (and would do again on the next album). This is the sound of stagnation. It´s overall still a quality release though, and a 3.5 star (70%) rating is deserved.</p>
